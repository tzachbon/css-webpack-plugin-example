# Writing the Loader
â€‹
So what are we aiming for? First things first, we want to simply load our CSS from our JS.
â€‹
Let's create our CSS file and call it `index.css`.
```css
.app {
	background: red;
}
```
â€‹
And of course, use it in the index.js file:
```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import './index.css'
â€‹
render(
  <div className="app"> Hello World! </div>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
â€‹
Run our application:
```bash
npm run serve
```
â€‹
Now you probably see this error in the console:
![Error](./assets/failed-to-load-css-error.png)
â€‹
This error makes a lot of sense, as webpack does not know how to handle CSS imports and we need to tell it how.

## Creating Webpack Loader
â€‹
### What are loaders?
â€‹
*webpack enables the use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle any static resource way beyond JavaScript.*
â€‹
To put it simply, in our case, they are functions that take the CSS file as input and output a js file.
_**CSS -> JS**_
â€‹
### Loader implementation
â€‹
Let's create a file parallel to the `webpack.config.js` named `loader.js`.
Our goal is to append the style value we get from the CSS file inside the dom.
â€‹
`loader.js`:
```js
â€‹
// Appending the style inside the head
function appendStyle(value) {
    const style = document.createElement('style');
    style.textContent = value;
    document.head.appendChild(style);
}
â€‹
// Make sure it is not an arrow function since we will need the `this` context of webpack
function loader(fileValue) {
  // We stringify the appendStyle method and creating a file that will invoked with the css file value in run time
  return `
    (${appendStyle.toString()})(${JSON.stringify(fileValue)})
  `
}
â€‹
module.exports = loader;
```
â€‹
Now we need to register it inside the webpack config.
â€‹
`webpack.config.js`:
```js
const config = {
  //... rest of the config
    module: {
        rules: [
          // ... other rules not related to CSS
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                loader: require.resolve('./loader')
            }
        ]
    }
  // ...
}
```
â€‹
Restart the terminal, and we got it! ðŸŽŠ

### Whatâ€™s happening behind the scenes?
â€‹
Webpack sees your CSS import inside `index.js`. It looks for a loader and gives it the JavaScript value we want to evaluate in runtime.
â€‹
## Overcoming the `global` issue
â€‹
Now we have our style, but everything is global. Every other language solves the global issue with scoping or namespacing.
â€‹
We will implement the namespace solution. This is going to give us scoping, and each file going to have its own namespace.
â€‹
For example, our import is going to look like this:
```
AppComponent123__myClass
```
â€‹
If another component has the same class name, it won't matter behind the scenes since the namespace will be different.
â€‹
Let's go the `loader.js` and add the following method:
```js
â€‹
const crypto = require('crypto');
â€‹
/**
 * The name is the class we are going to scope, and the file path is the value we are going to for the namespacing.
 * 
 * The third argument is the classes, a map that points the old name to the new one.
 */
function scope(name, filepath, classes) {
  name = name.slice(1); // Remove the dot from the name.
  const hash = crypto.createHash('sha1'); // Use sha1 algorithm.
  hash.write(filepath); // Hash the filepath.
  
  const namespace = hash.digest('hex').slice(0, 6); // Get the hashed filepath.
  const newName = `s${namespace}__${name}`;
â€‹
  classes[name] = newName; // Save the old and the new classes.
â€‹
  return `.${newName}`
}
```
â€‹
After we are done scoping the class, let's return the loader method.
We need a way to connect the scoped class selector to the user's javascript code.
â€‹
```js
function loader(fileValue) {
  const classes = {}; // Map that points the old name to the new one.
  const classRegex = /(\.([a-zA-Z_-]{1}[\w-_]+))/g; // Naive regex to match everything that start with dot.
  const scopedFileValue = fileValue.replace(classRegex, (name) => scope(name, this.resourcePath, classes)); // Replace the old class with the new one and add it to the classes object
â€‹
 // Change the fileValue to scopedFileValue and export the classes.
  return `
    (${appendStyle.toString()})(${JSON.stringify(scopedFileValue)})
â€‹
    export default ${JSON.stringify(classes)}
  ` // Export allows the user to use it in his javascript code
}
```
â€‹
In the `index.js`, we can now use it as an object:
â€‹
```js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from "react-dom";
import classes from './index.css'; // Import the classes object.
â€‹
render(
  <div className={classes.app}>
    Hello World
  </div>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```
â€‹
Now it works with namespaced selector ðŸŽ‰
â€‹

â€‹
<mark>Some important points about the changes we implemented.</mark>
â€‹
* When the loader is used by Webpack, the context will be the loader context (`this`) from Webpack. You can read more about it [here](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/). It provides the resolved file path, which makes the namespace unique to the file.
â€‹
* The way we extract the classes selectors from the CSS file is a naive implementation that isn't taking into account other use cases. The ideal way is to use a CSS parser.
* `this.resourcePath` refers to the local path, which means that in other machines, the path may look different.
â€‹
The loader is now implemented, and we've got scoped classes at this point. However, everything is loaded from JavaScript, and so it is not yet possible to cache the CSS.
â€‹
To do this, we will need to compose all the CSS into one file, and to do that, we will need to create a Webpack Plugin.
